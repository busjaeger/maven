Outstanding task for native partial build support and notes


1. implement generation provider to download models (Jason)
- see TODO in ProjectGraphBuilder#build binModels
- graph builder needs set of available IDs (versionless), but models could be loaded lazily
- may be desriable to make generation optional if not needed (full build or 'am')


2. Hook ProjectGraphBuilder into maven (Jason)
- graph builder builds trimmed, topo-sorted project graph
- subsumes functionality in DefaultMaven from getProjectsForMavenReactor to lifecycle execution


3. Use ProjectGraph during plugin and dependency resolution (Jason)
- when dependency resolution kicks in during lifecycle execution, ProjectGraph should take precedence
- in particular, ranges should be supported for in-reactor plugin projects


4. Hook DefaultModelBuilder into ProjectGraphBuilder (Ben)
- model builder should not try to read parent locally via relative path, but leave decision up to ModelResolver
- this allows for new resolver implementation that resolves parents purely based on coordinates


5. Support modes other than also-make-dependents (Ben)
- for also-make a source project forces its dependencies to be source as well
- for full-build mode all projects are 'selected'


6. Write unit tests for ProjectGraphBuilder (Ben)


7. Aggregate model loading errors instead of failing on first error


8. Implement range checking on resolved projects


9. Change validation rules to allow omitting version elements
- requires further discussion
